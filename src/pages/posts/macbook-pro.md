Macbook Pro (14-inch, 2021) is my main computer for app devs, designing, video editing, and everything else.
It's so powerful and really a good foundation to create digital stuff. It will stay with you regardless of how far you wanna go, how crazy you want to experiment whatever. And bonus:  It's portable!

So, I can enjoy coding wherever like at cafes, hotels, and even in nature :) Pretty awesome. It Would have not been possible film coding videos in nature like this, thanks to its high power efficiency.

  I chose 14-inch because 16-inch is too big for me. I connect it with [Pro Display XDR](https://uses.craftz.dog/posts/pro-display-xdr) at home.
